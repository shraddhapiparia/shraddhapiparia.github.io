		<h4>Top seven qualities of an entry-level computer science student with a bachelor degree applying for industrial jobs in India. </h4>
<p> Preparing for interview as a computer science graduate can be quite exhausting. In order to not be overwhelmed,
I decide to put together a list of major focus points which I feel are very important in my personal opinion.</p>
<ol><li> Must have a LinkedIn account. </li>
<li> Create a GitHub account and add at least one project showcasing the programming ability. Make sure that you understand each and every part of the project. If it is a group project then you should know the bigger
picture , have a general idea of what is used throughout the project, and explain your contribution clearly. You can add any computer science project from your practicles as well. DON'T PLAGIARIZE AT ANY COST. 
If possible show stages of SDLC or maybe add a design of the project or at the very least, add a class diagram.</li>

<li> Must know how to use the git/gitlab using command line interface. You can add some commands as an "additional" project in github. This will be considered as a very small project but it demonstrates your ability 
to do routine tasks easily once you are hired. </li>

<li> Must have solid fundamental knowledge of basic data structures including but not limited to array, strings, hashmap, heap, linked lists, number, trees, stack, queue, etc. from scratch (not using builtin functions).
 Add code for basic operations like insertion, deletion, append, delete wherever applicable. Use your favourite  programming language as an "additional" project in GitHub. </li>
 
<li> Practice problems from leetcode/hacker rank. Pick one language. Highly recommended languages are C/C++ and Java to understand object oriented programming concepts. Python works but is a less preferable choice 
in my personal opinion. </li>

<li> Profound understanding of searching and sorting algorithms along with time and space complexity with examples on how to apply them to solve a problem optimally. </li>

<li> Prepare a one page resume. Make it very concise by using optimal keywords. </li>

Bonus:
Host your personal website on GitHub demonstrating your profile. Allowed one per user.

<p> I hope this is helpful to you, not as a comprehensive guide, but as a guide to various topics that you must know before you apply for interviews.
Thank you for reading!
