    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

    <p>
      My work applies machine learning and statistical modeling to
      understand biological heterogeneity and treatment response, with applications in pharmacogenomics, molecular stratification, and large-scale biomedical data.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Sequence Modeling and Structured Prediction (PhD Work)</h3>
    <p>
      During my PhD, I developed methods to learn structure from complex, event-driven data
      using probabilistic and neural models. This included sequence modeling with
      conditional random fields, neural network–based component discovery, and
      combinatorial methods for large search spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work laid the foundation for my current interest in modeling biological
      sequences and high-dimensional molecular data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Representative publications:</em> CRF-based event pattern discovery,
      neural network–driven model element identification, and combinatorial testing
      of context-aware systems.

    <h3>2. Genotype Embeddings for Pharmacogenomics (Current)</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently developing representation learning approaches to model
      genotype data directly, with an emphasis on linkage disequilibrium–aware
      structure. Using autoencoders and transformer-based models, the goal is to
      learn reusable genomic embeddings that support downstream tasks such as
      patient stratification and drug response analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work aims to move beyond traditional single-variant or PRS-based
      approaches toward molecular representations.

    <h3>3. Endophenotype-driven GWAS Framework</h3>
    <p>
      To address heterogeneity in asthma, I developed machine learning–based
      endophenotypes that capture clinically meaningful variation in lung function
      and treatment response. These endophenotypes were incorporated into
      subtype-specific genetic association analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This framework improves interpretability and statistical power in
      pharmacogenomic studies by aligning genetic signals with biologically
      coherent patient subgroups.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Representative publications:</em> PCA based endophenotype definiton, ANOVA for endophenotype specific GWAS, Asthma pharmacogenetics through subtype specific associations.

    <h3>4. miRNA-based Biomarkers of Drug Response</h3>
    <p>
      I analyzed the role of microRNAs as modulators of inhaled corticosteroid
      response in asthma, focusing on miR-584-5p across two independent cohorts
      (CAMP and GACRS).
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis involved normalization and filtering of miRNA read counts,
      cohort-specific outcome definitions, and interaction modeling to assess how
      treatment modifies regulatory effects on asthma exacerbations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work provides mechanistic insight into regulatory pathways underlying
      corticosteroid resistance.

    <h3>5. Proteomics Analysis of Pediatric Long COVID</h3>
    <p>
      I conducted proteomic analysis using OLINK NPX data to study children with
      Long COVID presenting neurological symptoms. The project involved extensive
      data harmonization and careful handling of cases and controls originating
      from different clinical centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although cohort differences limited definitive conclusions, this work
      emphasized rigorous QC, normalization, and sensitivity analysis in
      high-dimensional proteomic studies.
