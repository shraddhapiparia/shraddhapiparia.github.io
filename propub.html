    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

    <p>
      My work applies machine learning and statistical modeling to study biological and clinical heterogeneity and treatment response, with applications in pharmacogenomics, molecular stratification, and large-scale biomedical data.

    <h3>Genotype Embeddings for Pharmacogenomics (Current)</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently developing representation learning approaches to model
      genotype data directly. Using variational autoencoder, the goal is to
      learn genotype embeddings that support downstream tasks such as
      patient stratification and drug response analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work aims to move beyond traditional single variant or PRS based
      approaches toward molecular representations.
    </p>

    <h3>Endophenotype-driven GWAS Framework</h3>
    <p>
      To address heterogeneity in asthma, I developed machine learning based
      endophenotypes that capture clinically meaningful variation in lung function
      and treatment response. These endophenotypes were incorporated into
      subtype-specific genetic association analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This framework improves interpretability and statistical power in
      pharmacogenomic studies by aligning genetic signals with biologically
      coherent patient subgroups.

    <h3>miRNA-based Biomarkers of Drug Response</h3>
    <p>
      I analyzed the role of microRNAs as modulators of inhaled corticosteroid
      response in asthma, focusing on miR-584-5p across two independent cohorts
      (CAMP and GACRS).
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis involved normalization and filtering of miRNA read counts,
      cohort-specific outcome definitions, and interaction modeling to assess how
      treatment modifies regulatory effects on asthma exacerbations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work provides mechanistic insight into regulatory pathways underlying
      corticosteroid resistance.

    <h3>Proteomics Analysis of Pediatric Long COVID</h3>
    <p>
      I conducted proteomic analysis using OLINK NPX data to study children with
      Long COVID presenting neurological symptoms. The project involved extensive
      data harmonization and careful handling of cases and controls originating
      from different clinical centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although cohort differences limited definitive conclusions, this work
      emphasized rigorous QC, normalization, and sensitivity analysis in
      high-dimensional proteomic studies.

    <h3>Machine Learning Analysis of Pediatric COVID-19 clinical data</h3>
    <p>
      I applied random forest models to clinical data from pediatric COVID-19 cohorts to perform case–control prediction and examine factors associated with infection status in children. The analysis focused on how demographic and clinical variables contributed to predictive performance.

    <h3>Context-aware testing of mobile applications</h3>
    <p>
  During my PhD, I developed methods to model event-driven data using probabilistic
  and neural approaches. This included sequence modeling with conditional random
  fields, neural network–based component discovery, and combinatorial methods
  for large search spaces.
</p>

<p>
  This work shaped how I approach modeling problems involving dependent
  observations, structured outputs, and constrained search spaces—ideas that
  continue to influence my applied machine learning work in biomedical domains.
