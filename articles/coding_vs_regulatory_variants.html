      <p>
        This article is part II of the Regulatory Variation & Functional Prediction series.
      </p>

      <h2>What GWAS is designed to detect</h2>

      <p>
        Genome-wide association studies test whether genetic variants are statistically associated with a trait across a population. The output of a GWAS is a set of loci where variation correlates with phenotypic differences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Importantly, GWAS does not measure molecular function directly. It identifies associations, not mechanisms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interpreting GWAS results therefore requires additional biological and statistical context.
      </p>

      <h2>The early focus on protein-coding variation</h2>

      <p>
        Early human genetics was shaped by the study of protein-coding mutations. Variants that altered amino acid sequences or disrupted protein structure often produced clear and reproducible phenotypic effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        This made coding variants a natural starting point for interpretation. Proteins offered a direct link between genotype and function.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many foundational tools for variant annotation were built around this perspective.
      </p>

      <h2>An empirical observation from GWAS</h2>

      <p>
        As GWAS datasets grew in size and scope, a consistent pattern emerged. Most variants associated with complex traits were not located in protein-coding regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, association signals were enriched in introns, intergenic regions, and known regulatory elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        This observation has been replicated across traits, populations, and study designs.
      </p>

      <h2>Why coding variants are uncommon among GWAS hits</h2>

      <p>
        Variants with large effects on protein function are often subject to strong purifying selection. As a result, they tend to be rare in the population.
      </p>

      <p>
        GWAS is optimized to detect common variants with modest effects rather than rare variants with large impacts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The relative scarcity of coding variants in GWAS signals is therefore consistent with both evolutionary constraints and study design.
      </p>

      <h2>Regulatory variants and effect size</h2>

      <p>
        Regulatory variants typically influence gene expression levels, timing, or cellular specificity rather than protein sequence.
      </p>

      <p>
        These effects are often subtle. A single variant may shift expression slightly rather than producing a binary change.
      </p>

      <p>
        When many such variants act together, their combined influence can shape complex traits.
      </p>

      <h2>Proximity does not imply mechanism</h2>

      <p>
        GWAS hits are frequently assigned to the nearest gene as a practical heuristic. However, regulatory elements can act over long genomic distances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enhancers may influence genes hundreds of kilobases away or interact with multiple targets depending on cellular context.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, physical proximity alone is not sufficient to infer causal mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>The role of functional annotation</h2>

      <p>
        Functional annotations provide valuable context by identifying overlaps with known regulatory features such as enhancers, promoters, and chromatin marks.
      </p>

      <p>
        These annotations help prioritize variants but do not directly predict how a sequence change alters regulatory activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many variants overlap multiple annotated features, complicating interpretation.
      </p>

      <h2>Coding and regulatory variation are complementary</h2>

      <p>
        The prominence of regulatory variants in GWAS does not diminish the importance of coding variation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coding variants remain central to the study of rare disease, Mendelian traits, and pharmacogenomics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Different classes of variation address different biological and clinical questions.
      </p>

      <h2>GWAS as a starting point</h2>

      <p>
        GWAS identifies regions of interest rather than complete mechanistic explanations.
      </p>

      <p>
        For noncoding associations, understanding how variants influence regulation becomes a necessary downstream step.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functional interpretation builds on GWAS rather than replacing it.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking ahead</h2>

      <p>
        GWAS identifies regions of interest, not mechanisms. For noncoding signals, the next step is learning how regulation is organized and how genetic variation perturbs it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding why most GWAS signals fall outside coding regions reframes the problem of disease biology. The question becomes not “Which protein is broken?” but “Which regulatory process is altered?”
