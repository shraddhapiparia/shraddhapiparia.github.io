      </header>

      <p>This article is part of the Foundations of Genomic Data series.</p>

      <h2>What does DNA sequencing capture?</h2>
      <p>DNA sequencing is the process of reading the order of nucleotides along the genome. Conceptually, it provides access to the complete genetic code an individual carries.</p>

      <p>Importantly, sequencing does not selectively read genes. It reads whatever DNA is present in the sampled material. This includes protein-coding regions, noncoding regions, regulatory elements, and repetitive sequences.</p>

      <p>As a result, DNA sequencing captures potential biological variation rather than biological activity.</p>

      <h2>Most of the genome is not protein-coding</h2>
      <p>A common misconception is that DNA sequencing is primarily about genes. In reality, protein-coding regions account for only a small fraction of the genome.</p>

      <p>The figure below summarizes the approximate composition of the human genome. Only a small portion corresponds to protein-coding exons, while much larger fractions consist of intronic, regulatory, and repetitive sequences.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>This matters because DNA sequencing inherently measures far more than gene-coding changes. Many variants identified through sequencing lie outside exons and influence biology indirectly, through regulation or genome structure.</p>

      <h2>Types of DNA sequencing</h2>
      <p>DNA sequencing is applied at different scopes depending on the scientific question.</p>

      <p>Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) reads nearly the entire genome. It provides the most comprehensive view of genetic variation, including noncoding and structural variants.</p>

      <p>Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) targets only protein-coding regions. While more limited, it is efficient for studies focused on coding mutations, particularly in rare disease settings.</p>

      <p>Targeted sequencing focuses on predefined genomic regions. This approach is useful when prior biological knowledge narrows the search space.</p>

      <p>Each strategy reflects a tradeoff between coverage, cost, and interpretability.</p>

      <h2>What DNA sequencing is good at</h2>
      <p>DNA sequencing is particularly well suited for identifying inherited genetic variation. Common applications include:</p>

      <p>Discovery of single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions.</p>
      <p>Detection of structural variants.</p>
      <p>Characterization of rare mutations.</p>
      <p>Population-level genetic analysis.</p>

      <p>Because DNA is largely stable across cells, sequencing provides a consistent reference layer that supports downstream analyses.</p>

      <h2>What DNA sequencing does not measure</h2>
      <p>DNA sequencing does not indicate whether a gene is active, suppressed, or differentially expressed. Two individuals with identical DNA sequences may show very different biological behavior at the RNA or protein level.</p>

      <p>This limitation is not a flaw; it reflects the biological role of DNA itself. Sequencing reveals the genetic substrate, not its real-time execution.</p>

      <h2>Why sequencing is only one part of the picture</h2>
      <p>DNA sequencing explains what genetic variation exists, but not how that variation manifests in cells or tissues. For this reason, sequencing is often complemented by RNA-based measurements and other molecular assays.</p>

      <p>Later articles in this series discuss how RNA sequencing and genotyping approaches build on DNA sequencing to answer different biological questions, and how these layers can be integrated.</p>
