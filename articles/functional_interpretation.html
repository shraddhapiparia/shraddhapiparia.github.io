        <h1>From Variants to Effects: What Does Functional Interpretation Mean in Genomics?</h1>
      </header>

      <p>
        This article is part I of the Regulatory Variation & Functional Prediction series.
      </p>

      <h2>The variant bottleneck</h2>

      <p>
        Modern sequencing technologies make it possible to identify millions of genetic variants in a single individual. Large population studies now catalog variation at a scale that was not feasible a decade ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, the limiting factor in genomics is no longer the ability to detect variants. It is the ability to understand what, if anything, those variants do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functional interpretation exists to address this gap between measurement and biological meaning.
      </p>

      <h2>What does it mean to interpret a variant?</h2>

      <p>
        Variant interpretation is often described loosely, but it refers to a specific question: how does a change in DNA sequence influence biological processes?
      </p>

      <p>
        This is distinct from identifying where a variant occurs or how frequently it appears in a population. Interpretation focuses on downstream consequences rather than genomic location alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, interpretation connects genotype to intermediate molecular effects, and only indirectly to phenotype.
      </p>

      <h2>Between genotype and phenotype</h2>

      <p>
        Genetic variants do not act on traits directly. Their effects are mediated through multiple layers of cellular organization, including chromatin structure, transcription, RNA processing, and protein abundance.
      </p>

      <p>
        These layers form a cascade rather than a single step. A variant may subtly shift regulatory activity without producing an immediate or deterministic phenotypic outcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functional interpretation therefore requires reasoning about intermediate biological mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>The classical focus on protein-coding variation</h2>

      <p>
        Early successes in human genetics were largely driven by variants that disrupted protein-coding sequences. Changes that introduced stop codons, altered amino acids, or destabilized proteins were comparatively straightforward to interpret.
      </p>

      <p>
        This framing shaped many early tools for variant annotation and prioritization. Protein sequence provided a concrete and mechanistic reference point.
      </p>

      <p>
        For certain diseases, particularly rare Mendelian disorders, this approach remains highly effective.
      </p>

      <h2>Most variants do not alter proteins</h2>

      <p>
        Genome-wide studies have since shown that the majority of common disease-associated variants lie outside protein-coding regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        These variants fall within introns, regulatory elements, or intergenic regions. They do not change the amino acid sequence of proteins, yet they are reproducibly associated with phenotypic variation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their effects, when present, are often mediated through changes in gene regulation rather than protein structure.
      </p>

      <h2>Expanding the definition of function</h2>

      <p>
        Functional interpretation in a regulatory context refers to how variants influence when, where, and how strongly genes are expressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This includes effects on transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, RNA splicing, and other regulatory processes that shape cellular behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        A variant can be functionally relevant even if the encoded protein remains unchanged.
      </p>

      <h2>Why regulatory effects are harder to interpret</h2>

      <p>
        Regulatory effects are often context-dependent. A variant may influence gene expression in one cell type but have little effect in another.
      </p>

      <p>
        These effects are also typically modest in magnitude. Rather than causing binary disruptions, regulatory variants tend to shift probabilities and expression levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike coding variants, regulatory variation rarely follows simple, universal rules.
      </p>

      <h2>Functional effects are not binary</h2>

      <p>
        It is tempting to classify variants as either functional or non-functional. In practice, regulatory effects are better understood as continuous and probabilistic.
      </p>

      <p>
        A variant may slightly increase expression under specific conditions or alter regulatory dynamics only in certain developmental stages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functional interpretation therefore involves uncertainty rather than definitive labels.
      </p>

      <h2>From annotation to prediction</h2>

      <p>
        Early approaches to regulatory interpretation relied on static annotations, such as overlap with known regulatory elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        While useful, annotations do not directly model how sequence changes alter regulatory behavior. They describe context but do not predict effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        This limitation has motivated a shift toward predictive models that estimate regulatory consequences directly from DNA sequence.
      </p>

      <h2>Why functional interpretation matters now</h2>

      <p>
        As genomic datasets continue to grow, experimental validation of every variant is not feasible. Computational interpretation plays an increasingly central role in prioritization and hypothesis generation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding regulatory effects is particularly important for complex traits, where many variants contribute small, distributed influences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functional interpretation provides a framework for connecting large-scale genetic variation to biological mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking ahead</h2>

      <p>
        This article establishes the conceptual foundation for regulatory variant effect prediction. Later posts in this series explore how regulatory effects are modeled, why deep sequence-based approaches have become viable, and what their limitations remain.
