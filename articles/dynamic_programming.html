      <p>
        I initially thought of sequence alignment as a specialized technique within bioinformatics. When I encountered it more closely, many of its core ideas felt familiar from introductory algorithms courses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Concepts such as dynamic programming, hashing, and indexed search appear again in alignment algorithms, adapted to longer strings and biological constraints. The similarity is not exact, but the connection is hard to miss.
      </p>

      <h2>From exact matching to scored similarity</h2>

      <p>
        In classic string matching, the task is often framed as a decision problem: does a pattern occur in a larger text, and if so, where. Algorithms such as Knuth–Morris–Pratt or Boyer–Moore are designed to answer this efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Biological sequences introduce a different requirement. Rather than asking for exact matches, alignment methods ask how similar two sequences are when substitutions, insertions, and deletions are allowed. This shift replaces binary outcomes with scoring schemes that balance matches against penalties.
      </p>

      <h2>Dynamic programming in alignment algorithms</h2>

      <p>
        Global and local alignment methods, such as Needleman–Wunsch and Smith–Waterman, rely on dynamic programming formulations closely related to edit distance. A matrix is filled by considering matches, mismatches, and gaps, with each cell representing the best score up to that point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Smith–Waterman introduces a local reset that allows alignments to start and end anywhere within the sequences. While the biological interpretation differs, the underlying dynamic programming structure remains similar to formulations taught in computer science courses.
      </p>

      <h2>Scaling beyond quadratic time</h2>

      <p>
        For long sequences or large databases, full dynamic programming becomes computationally expensive. Practical aligners therefore rely on heuristics that narrow the search space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tools such as BLAST use short exact matches as seeds and extend them with localized alignment. This approach avoids filling the entire dynamic programming matrix while still recovering high-scoring alignments.
      </p>

      <h2>Indexing and modern aligners</h2>

      <p>
        More recent methods index reference genomes using data structures such as suffix arrays or FM-indexes. These structures enable rapid identification of candidate alignment locations, which are then refined using limited dynamic programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of these indexing techniques originate from string algorithms developed well before large-scale sequencing became practical.
      </p>

      <h2>A practical connection</h2>

      <p>
        Sequence alignment can be viewed as an instance of approximate string matching adapted to biological data. Dynamic programming provides optimality guarantees within a defined scoring system, while heuristics and indexing make the computation tractable at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        What stands out is not that bioinformatics reinvented these ideas, but that foundational algorithmic techniques continue to support new domains as problem sizes and constraints evolve.
