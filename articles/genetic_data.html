        This article is part of the Foundations of Genomic Data series.

      <h2>What is meant by genetic data?</h2>

      <p>
        In biological research, genetic data usually refers to measurements derived from molecules involved in storing or expressing genetic information. Most often, this includes DNA and RNA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although closely related, DNA and RNA correspond to different aspects of biological systems. They are therefore measured using different technologies and used to address different kinds of questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clarifying this distinction helps frame later discussions about sequencing technologies, genotyping assays, and downstream analysis.
      </p>

      <h2>DNA and RNA as distinct biological layers</h2>

      <p>
        DNA encodes inherited genetic information. With limited exceptions, an individual’s DNA sequence remains stable across cells and over time. Variation at the DNA level captures differences such as single-nucleotide changes and larger structural alterations.
      </p>

      <p>
        RNA reflects gene expression. RNA molecules are transcribed from DNA, and their abundance varies across tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. RNA measurements therefore provide a snapshot of cellular activity under specific conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way to think about the distinction is that DNA constrains what is possible, while RNA reflects which possibilities are realized in a given context.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because these layers capture different signals, neither is sufficient on its own for most biological questions.
      </p>

      <h2>Why multiple measurement approaches exist</h2>

      <p>
        There is no single method that captures all aspects of genetic information. Different research goals require access to different biological layers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Studies focused on inherited risk emphasize DNA variation, while studies of cellular response, development, or disease progression often rely on RNA-based measurements.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, genetic data technologies fall into a few broad categories:
      </p>

      <p>
        Methods that read DNA sequence. Methods that quantify RNA abundance. Methods that assay selected genetic variants without sequencing entire genomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each approach involves tradeoffs among resolution, cost, scale, and interpretability.
      </p>

      <h2>Sequencing and targeted measurement</h2>

      <p>
        DNA and RNA sequencing are often discussed together, but they serve different purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        DNA sequencing reads the underlying genetic sequence and is well suited for identifying variants, rare mutations, and structural changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        RNA sequencing measures transcripts derived from DNA and provides quantitative information about gene expression and splicing. It does not directly capture most inherited genetic variation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Genotyping arrays form a third category. Rather than sequencing, they measure predefined variants across the genome. While limited in scope, they scale efficiently to large populations and are widely used in association studies.
      </p>

      <h2>Why these distinctions matter</h2>

      <p>
        Confusion can arise when different data types are treated as interchangeable. In practice, they address different questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        DNA-based data supports inference about inherited differences. RNA-based data informs functional activity. Genotyping enables population-scale analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Choosing among these data types shapes what kinds of biological conclusions can reasonably be drawn.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking ahead</h2>

      <p>
        Later posts in this series examine DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and genotyping in more detail, followed by discussions of how these data types are combined in integrative analyses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding what genetic data represents provides context for all of these approaches.
