      <h1>What Regularization Means in Representation Learning</h1>

      <p>
        Regularization is often described as a way to prevent overfitting. While this description is broadly accurate, it can obscure an important distinction: different regularization methods act on different aspects of a model.
      </p>

      <p>
        In representation learning, particularly in variational autoencoders (VAEs), this distinction becomes more visible. Regularization influences not only generalization performance, but also the properties of the learned latent representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This post focuses on regularization methods commonly used in VAEs, with emphasis on KL divergence and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and briefly situates them alongside more familiar techniques.
      </p>

      <h2>Two broad levels of regularization</h2>

      <p>
        Regularization methods can be loosely grouped according to what they constrain.
      </p>

      <h2>Parameter-level regularization</h2>

      <p>
        Parameter-level methods act directly on network weights or activations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common examples include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>L2 regularization (weight decay), which discourages large weights.</li>
        <li>L1 regularization, which encourages sparse parameter usage.</li>
        <li>Dropout, which introduces stochasticity during training.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These techniques primarily influence the complexity of the learned function. They do not explicitly constrain the structure of a learned latent representation.
      </p>

      <h2>Distribution-level regularization</h2>

      <p>
        Distribution-level regularization constrains the distribution of latent variables rather than individual parameters.
      </p>

      <p>
        This becomes relevant in VAEs, where the model is trained to match an encoder-defined distribution to a chosen prior. KL divergence and MMD are two commonly used approaches in this setting.
      </p>

      <h2>Why VAEs introduce distribution-level constraints</h2>

      <p>
        VAEs balance reconstruction accuracy with a constraint on the latent distribution. Without this constraint, the latent space can become highly structured in ways that improve reconstruction but make comparison or reuse of embeddings more difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
        Distribution-level regularization is often used to encourage continuity, comparability, or stability in the latent space, depending on the modeling goal.
      </p>

      <h2>KL divergence in VAEs</h2>

      <p>
        KL divergence measures how much the encoder’s approximate posterior deviates from the prior distribution. In the standard VAE formulation, it limits how much information the latent variables carry beyond what is needed for reconstruction.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, KL regularization:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Encourages alignment between posterior and prior distributions.</li>
        <li>Promotes smoother latent representations.</li>
        <li>Is typically weighted to balance reconstruction and regularization.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If overly strong, KL regularization can reduce the information carried by the latent variables, a behavior often referred to as posterior collapse. This outcome depends on architecture, loss scaling, and training dynamics.
      </p>

      <h2>MMD as an alternative</h2>

      <p>
        Maximum Mean Discrepancy offers an alternative way to compare distributions by matching samples using kernel-based statistics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to KL divergence, MMD:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Does not rely on an explicit parametric form for the distributions.</li>
        <li>Operates at the sample level rather than through an analytic divergence.</li>
        <li>Introduces sensitivity to kernel choice and batch-level effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In some settings, MMD can provide a more flexible form of distribution matching, though it also introduces additional design choices.
      </p>

      <h2>Choosing between KL and MMD</h2>

      <p>
        The choice between KL divergence and MMD is typically guided by modeling priorities rather than reconstruction error alone.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>KL divergence is often chosen for its simplicity and theoretical grounding.</li>
        <li>MMD may be preferred when KL-based training leads to unstable or overly constrained representations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Switching between these regularizers changes how the latent space is shaped and how embeddings should be interpreted.
      </p>

      <h2>Implications for genomic representation learning</h2>

      <p>
        In applications such as genotype or LD-aware embeddings, reconstruction metrics alone may not reflect whether a representation is useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Properties such as stability across runs, comparability across genomic blocks, and suitability for downstream modeling are influenced by distribution-level regularization choices.
      </p>

      <h2>Takeaway</h2>

      <p>
        Regularization encompasses multiple mechanisms operating at different levels of a model.
      </p>

      <p>
        In VAEs used for representation learning, KL divergence and MMD provide different ways of shaping latent distributions. Choosing between them is part of defining what kind of representation a model is encouraged to learn.
