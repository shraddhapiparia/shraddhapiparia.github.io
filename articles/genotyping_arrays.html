      <h2>What do genotyping arrays measure?</h2>

      <p>
        Genotyping arrays measure variation at a predefined set of genetic locations across the genome. Each location corresponds to a known genetic variant, most commonly a single-nucleotide polymorphism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike DNA sequencing, genotyping arrays do not read continuous stretches of DNA. Instead, they query whether specific variants are present or absent in a sample.
      </p>

      <p>
        The resulting data represent a sparse but structured snapshot of genetic variation.
      </p>

      <h2>Designed measurement rather than discovery</h2>

      <p>
        The variants included on a genotyping array are selected in advance. Their choice reflects prior knowledge about population genetics, disease associations, and linkage disequilibrium structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, genotyping arrays are designed to measure known variation efficiently rather than to discover novel mutations.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of genotyping platforms</h2>

      <p>
        Most modern genotyping arrays are based on SNP microarray technology and are produced by platforms such as Illumina and Affymetrix.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some arrays are designed for specific populations or traits, while others aim to provide broad genome-wide coverage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Multi-ethnic arrays attempt to capture variation across diverse ancestral backgrounds by including variants informative in multiple populations.
      </p>

      <h2>From sparse measurement to genome-wide coverage</h2>

      <p>
        Although genotyping arrays directly measure only a subset of variants, their coverage can be expanded through imputation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imputation uses reference panels, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, HRC, or TOPMed, to infer unmeasured variants based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium.
      </p>

      <p>
        This process leverages the structured correlation between nearby variants to infer a denser representation of genetic variation.
      </p>

      <h2>What genotyping arrays are well suited for</h2>

      <p>
        Genotyping arrays are widely used in large-scale population studies where cost, consistency, and sample size are critical considerations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common applications include genome-wide association studies, polygenic risk score construction, ancestry inference, and epidemiological research.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their standardized design enables direct comparison across cohorts and studies.
      </p>

      <h2>What genotyping arrays do not measure</h2>

      <p>
        Genotyping arrays do not capture rare or novel variants outside their predefined set. Structural variants and non-SNP variation are also poorly represented.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like DNA sequencing, arrays do not provide information about gene expression or regulatory activity.
      </p>

      <h2>Genotyping arrays as one layer of genomic data</h2>

      <p>
        Genotyping arrays occupy a middle ground between comprehensive sequencing and functional assays. They provide scalable access to genetic variation while relying on population structure for inference.
      </p>

      <p>
        In combination with sequencing, RNA measurements, and other data types, genotyping arrays contribute to a layered understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships.
