      <p>
        A colleague once suggested I read <cite>Future Shock</cite> by Alvin Toffler. Written in 1970, the book centers on a simple observation: rapid change can overwhelm people and institutions before they have time to adapt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Research environments make this especially visible. Methods evolve, tools are replaced, and entire subfields can shift direction within a few years. Stability is the exception rather than the norm.
      </p>

      <h2>Change as a working condition</h2>

      <p>
        Rather than treating change as an occasional disruption, it may be more accurate to see it as a persistent condition of research work. Projects, collaborations, and even expertise can become outdated faster than expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        This does not necessarily imply failure. It reflects the pace at which knowledge and technology move.
      </p>

      <h2>Practices that seem to help</h2>

      <p>
        Over time, researchers develop informal strategies for operating under these conditions. None are guarantees, but some patterns recur:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Allocating regular time to survey new tools and ideas, without feeling compelled to adopt all of them.</li>
        <li>Accepting that not every project reaches a traditional endpoint, and that partial results can still be shared.</li>
        <li>Being selective about novelty, distinguishing between methods that clarify a question and those that merely attract attention.</li>
        <li>Working across disciplines, which can broaden perspective when familiar approaches stall.</li>
        <li>Maintaining summaries, notes, and peer conversations that help reconnect day-to-day work with broader goals.</li>
        <li>Continuing to reskill while recognizing that no skill set remains sufficient indefinitely.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are not prescriptions so much as observations about how researchers adapt over time.
      </p>

      <h2>A reframing, not a solution</h2>

      <p>
        Change in research is unlikely to slow down. Treating adaptability as an ongoing practice rather than a one-time adjustment can make this reality easier to work with.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that sense, “future shock” is less a problem to solve than a condition to navigate—one that shapes how research is planned, evaluated, and sustained.
