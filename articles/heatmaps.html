      <p>
        Heatmaps are widely used in biology and data analysis. A matrix of values is mapped to color, often accompanied by hierarchical clustering. The result is visually compact and easy to scan.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is less obvious is that a heatmap combines several analytical choices: how values are scaled, how similarity is defined, and when clustering is applied. The visualization reflects these choices as much as it reflects the data itself.
      </p>

      <h2>An often-overlooked step</h2>

      <p>
        In many plotting libraries, clustering and scaling are handled automatically using default settings. These defaults may differ across tools and are not always applied in the order users expect.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, clustering may be performed on raw values while colors are displayed after scaling. This can produce clusters that reflect absolute magnitude, even though the color patterns emphasize relative trends.
      </p>

      <h2>Why interpretation depends on context</h2>

      <p>
        In gene expression analysis, this distinction matters. Clustering on raw expression levels groups genes by overall abundance, while clustering on scaled values groups genes by shared expression patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both approaches can be appropriate, but they answer different questions. Confusion arises when the visual appearance suggests one interpretation while the underlying clustering reflects another.
      </p>

      <h2>Being explicit about similarity</h2>

      <p>
        Heatmaps work best when the definition of similarity is chosen deliberately. Euclidean distance emphasizes absolute differences, while correlation-based measures emphasize shared structure across samples or conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Making these choices explicit helps align the visualization with the biological or analytical question being asked.
      </p>

      <h2>A practical takeaway</h2>

      <p>
        Heatmaps are not just visual summaries. They encode assumptions about scaling, distance, and ordering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interpreting them requires understanding how those assumptions were applied. The colors do not stand alone; they sit on top of a sequence of analytical decisions.
