        This article is part of the Foundations of Genomic Data series.

      <h2>What does RNA sequencing capture?</h2>

      <p>
        RNA sequencing measures the abundance and composition of RNA molecules present in a biological sample at a given moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike DNA sequencing, which records a largely stable genetic sequence, RNA sequencing reflects active biological processes. It captures which genes are being transcribed, how strongly, and in some cases how transcripts are processed.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this reason, RNA sequencing is best understood as a snapshot of gene activity rather than genetic potential.
      </p>

      <h2>From DNA to RNA</h2>

      <p>
        Cells share the same DNA but differ in function because they express different sets of genes. RNA serves as the intermediate layer that connects genetic information to cellular behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        Measuring RNA therefore provides insight into regulatory programs, environmental responses, and cell identity that are not visible at the DNA level alone.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of RNA sequencing</h2>

      <p>
        RNA sequencing can be applied in several forms, depending on the biological question.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bulk RNA sequencing measures average gene expression across a population of cells. It is well suited for comparing conditions, tissues, or disease states.
      </p>

      <p>
        Single-cell RNA sequencing measures expression at the level of individual cells. This enables the study of cellular heterogeneity, rare cell populations, and developmental trajectories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Small RNA sequencing focuses on short RNA species such as microRNAs. These molecules play regulatory roles and are often studied in the context of post-transcriptional control.
      </p>

      <h2>Library preparation as a modeling choice</h2>

      <p>
        RNA sequencing does not measure all RNA molecules equally. Library preparation determines which transcripts are captured and quantified.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poly-A selection enriches for messenger RNA by targeting polyadenylated transcripts. This approach emphasizes protein-coding genes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ribosomal RNA depletion removes abundant ribosomal RNA, allowing a broader range of coding and noncoding transcripts to be measured.
      </p>

      <p>
        These choices influence what aspects of gene regulation are observable and should be considered part of the experimental design rather than a technical detail.
      </p>

      <h2>What RNA sequencing is well suited for</h2>

      <p>
        RNA sequencing is commonly used to quantify gene expression and compare transcriptional states across samples.
      </p>

      <p>
        It supports analyses such as differential expression, splicing variation, transcript discovery, and inference of cell-type composition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because RNA levels can change rapidly, RNA sequencing is particularly informative for studying dynamic biological responses.
      </p>

      <h2>What RNA sequencing does not measure</h2>

      <p>
        RNA sequencing does not directly measure protein abundance or activity. Post-transcriptional and post-translational processes can further modify cellular behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also does not capture genetic variation with the same completeness or accuracy as DNA sequencing.
      </p>

      <h2>RNA sequencing as part of a larger picture</h2>

      <p>
        RNA sequencing provides a functional layer between genotype and phenotype. On its own, it offers partial insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        When combined with DNA sequencing and other molecular measurements, it helps reveal how genetic variation translates into biological outcomes.
